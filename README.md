# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Neural-Network-Random-Forest-and-XGboost
Our project focused on predicting customer churn using machine learning. We explored algorithms like neural networks, random forest, and XGBoost. By addressing dataset imbalance and employing metrics like F1 score and confusion matrices, we aimed to improve churn prediction accuracy and retention strategies.
